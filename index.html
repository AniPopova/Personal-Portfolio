          <p> I'm with a deep passion for coding and an ambitious dream to become a great developer. I tried many thing before to decide to follow my dreams.
            I was interpreter, BOD assistant, an accountant, bottom-up oprational controller but finally I found my way to feel that what I do actually have sence and I can see myself the result of my effords.
            The best thing about developers life is that you can code from every part of the world and every time during the day. You can create something that makes other people life easier.
          This is how I feel when my code is running and the "bugs" are killed...</p>

            I really love coding, and I've got this big dream of becoming a
            great developer. Before I decided to chase after that dream, I
            tried out a bunch of different jobs - I was an interpreter, a BOD
            (Board of Directors) assistant, an accountant, and even a
            bottom-up operational controller. But you know what? I finally
            found my groove and started to see the real impact of what I do.
            The coolest thing about being a developer is that you can code
            from anywhere in the world, anytime during the day. You get to
            build stuff that makes other people's lives easier. That's the
            feeling I get when my code is up and running smoothly, and those
            pesky "bugs" are all sorted out.
