This web page is made to serve to those who want to know something more about me.
It is separated in three sections:

Here you can read about my education, latest activities and goals I have.
Some kind of short biography.
 # 2. Interests
Here you can read and get more familiar with my interests like:
- Causes I support that really matters to me - Donation for stray cats all over the world.
- Things that I really love - Coffee is one of my biggest passions and additions.
